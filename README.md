# AIxBio Workshops

Materials for AI x Bio workshops. Initially for "Ctrl+Alt+Biology: Workshops series on enabling AI approaches in biological research" 2026 at UCL. The repository is actively under development!

For each workshop we will collate:
* Colab notebook(s) with step-by-step guides on the content covered. Can use ColabFold notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb) as a model.
* List of links to webpages, videos etc. as (essential/optional) reading prior to the workshop

## Outline
Each workshop is 3 hours:
* 45 min-1h (max) lecture
* around 2h practical
We don't have to stick to this format - e.g. lecture dispersed across 3h before going through each part of the notebook! This is just an indication on the relative proportion of time that should be allowed for practical work.

## Logistics
This is the plan - for each workshop:
* Approx 3 weeks before: meeting to plan exact content to be delivered; Joseph to write email to mailing lists and encourage registration (to close 1 week before)
* Approx 1 week before: registration close. Send out list of pre-session resources to participants. Joseph to organise catering
